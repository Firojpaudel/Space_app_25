"Microgravity Effects on Bone Density in Long-Duration Spaceflight","This study examines the impact of microgravity exposure on bone mineral density in astronauts during missions lasting 6 months or longer on the International Space Station. Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, we measured bone density changes in 24 crew members before, during, and after flight. Results show significant bone loss in weight-bearing bones, with recovery patterns varying by location and individual factors.","Smith JA, Johnson BK, Williams CL, Davis MD","Journal of Space Medicine",2023-03-15,10.1234/jsm.2023.001,https://example.com/paper1,"microgravity, bone density, astronauts, ISS, spaceflight"
"Stem Cell Behavior in Simulated Microgravity Conditions","Investigation of human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation under simulated microgravity using a clinostat. We cultured stem cells for 14 days and analyzed changes in gene expression, protein production, and cellular morphology. Findings indicate altered osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation pathways in microgravity conditions.","Rodriguez AM, Chen LX, Thompson PQ","Stem Cell Research International",2023-07-22,10.1234/scri.2023.042,https://example.com/paper2,"stem cells, microgravity, differentiation, clinostat, gene expression"
